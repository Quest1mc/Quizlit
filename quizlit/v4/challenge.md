# Quizlit challenge 4

## Apply colors to your app 

By using inline styles

For examples of how to use inline styles look at `toodoo-lit/v4/index.html`

## Challenge mode

[ ] Copy `index.html`, `wrong.html` and `correct.html` from `quizlit/v3` to `quizlit/v4`  

In `index.html`: 

[ ] Change the background of your big heading to `dodgerblue`  
[ ] Center the text of big heading  
[ ] Change the color of text of the big heading to white  
[ ] Give each answer a different background color  
[ ] Change the background of the body to `#ECF0F1`

## Easy mode:

1. Copy `index.html`, `wrong.html` and `correct.html` from `quizlit/v3` to `quizlit/v4`

2. In `index.html`: 

3. Replace the big heading by the HTML below. **It should make the big heading red**
```html
<h1 style="background-color: white; color: red; text-align: left;">My awesome app</h1>
```

4. Now change the values to the style rules:

    - Change the value of background-color to: `dodgerblue`
    - Change the value of color to: `white`
    - Change the value of text-align to: `center`

5. Add a style attribute to the `body` tag and add the following style rule `background-color: #ECF0F1`. This should make the body grey.

6. Using the same technique apply a different background color to each answer. Use the following hex color codes as values: 

    - Yellow: `#FEDC25`
    - Blue: `#1E90FF`
    - Green: `#80C683`
    - Orange: `#F1662B`
